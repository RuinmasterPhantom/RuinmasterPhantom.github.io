    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Hello world, I'm hosted with Github Pages.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey, I'm Josh. I'm a Computer Science: Game Design major in my 4th year at UC Santa Cruz.
        I love games with rich lore that you can get lost in, like Elden Ring or RuneScape.
        That's probably why I'm also a writer, though all those history and mythology books may have also had something to do with it.
        I have some programming experience in C/C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
        The only game engines I've worked with so far are RPG Maker and GODOT, anything else I've made has all been raw code.
        I'm looking forward to learning more.</p>
